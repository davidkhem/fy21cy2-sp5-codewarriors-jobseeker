# Code Warriors Job Seeker
## Problem
New client wants me to build a simple web app that shows the most recent jobs for software engineering jobs in the last 48 hours.
#### Client's Key Criteria
1. Most recent 10 jobs.
2. Jobs within the last 48 hours.
3. Able to change the date, and it'll show the last 48 hours from user chosen date (YYYY-MM-DD). 
4. Able to save job.
5. Saved job should be visible on homepage, along with the recent 10 jobs.
6. **Don't need to use any database.**
7. [Bonus] Come up with fancy name.

## Process and Solution
I start off by understanding what the client wants and why. Then I design a mock wireframe using Balsamiq. The layout gives me a visual on what the client's app would look like. Also, provide me a guide on how to start building.
Build the web app. I use html and tailwind css to do that part. Tailwind CSS and MDN Web Docs websites are very helpful.
I add an image of software engineers working. The light blue color of the page shows a welcoming vibe for user.

I sign up with Adzuna to use their job search API. It was a quick process by just creating an account with them and got access to the ID and Key almost immediately.
Also sign up for Postman inorder to use the API. Figuring out Adzuna API and adding the url into Postman to generate the json file was kind of complicated, because I kept getting the incorrect info. So there was a lot of playing around with the parameters.

The next step is to write out the javascript part. I type out the pseudocode first, so I can figure out my workflow.
Add the variables, then the event listener, and functions next. Issues that I ran into were grabbing data from the API.

After completion, it was uploaded to GitHub and deployed on Vercel. I made sure the pages are link correctly.
