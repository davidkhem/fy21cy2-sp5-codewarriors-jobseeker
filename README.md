# Job & Jobs
## Problem
New client wants us to build a simple web app that shows the most recent jobs for software engineering jobs in the last 48 hours.

### Client's Key Criteria
1. Most recent 10 jobs.
2. Jobs within the last 48 hours.
3. Able to change the date, and it'll show the last 48 hours from user chosen date (YYYY-MM-DD). 
4. Able to save job.
5. Saved job should be visible on homepage, along with the recent 10 jobs.
6. **Don't need to use any database.**
7. [Bonus] Come up with fancy name.

## Process and Solution
I start off by creating and designing the input box for the user to enter their guess number. I use html and tailwind css to do that part. Tailwind CSS and MDN Wed Docs websites are very helpful.
I add an image of Jigsaw from the Saw movies. He is known to play games. The dark color of the page shows the creepiness and dark vibe, but fun and adventurist.

The next step is to write out the javascript part. I type out the pseudocode first, so I can figure out my workflow.
Add the variables, then the functions. Issues that I ran into were coding the functions and adding messages.
The if statements are added to show how close the user's guess number to the secret random number generated.

After completion, it was uploaded to GitHub and deployed on Vercel. I made sure the pages are link correctly.
