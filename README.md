## Problem

### Criteria
1. Your app should include a main function that takes no argument.
2. When the page loads, the functions chooses a random number between 0 and 100 (see: [https://mzl.la/3yr0kfS](https://mzl.la/3yr0kfS)).
3. Your app should ask the user to guess the number your app picked.
4. Every time they submit, it should give the one of the following feedback: "Number too high", "Number Too low", or "Just Right".
5. If they guessed correctly, the program shows "Just Right" (or a bonus, blows them a confetti see: [https://bit.ly/3At1eud](https://bit.ly/3At1eud)).
6. Your app should only stop after the user guesses the correct number.

## Process and Solution
I start off by creating and designing the input box for the user to enter their guess number. I use html and tailwind css to do that part. Tailwind CSS and MDN Wed Docs websites are very helpful.
I add an image of Jigsaw from the Saw movies. He is known to play games. The dark color of the page shows the creepiness and dark vibe, but fun and adventurist.

The next step is to write out the javascript part. I type out the pseudocode first, so I can figure out my workflow.
Add the variables, then the functions. Issues that I ran into were coding the functions and adding messages.
The if statements are added to show how close the user's guess number to the secret random number generated.
After completion, it was uploaded to GitHub and deployed on Vercel. I made sure the pages are link correctly.
